The research paper "Multistep electric vehicle charging station occupancy prediction using hybrid LSTM neural networks" proposes a novel approach
for predicting the occupancy of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations using hybrid 
long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. The study highlights the importance of accurate occupancy prediction for efficient EV charging
management, cost reduction, and better customer service.

The authors develop a hybrid LSTM model that combines both the global and local information of the charging station occupancy time series data.
The global information is captured using a stacked LSTM layer, while the local information is captured using a residual LSTM layer. 
The hybrid LSTM model is trained using multistep prediction, where the model predicts the occupancy of multiple future time steps simultaneously.

The authors evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on a real-world dataset of EV charging station occupancy.
The results show that the hybrid LSTM model outperforms other baseline models, such as the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)
model and the feedforward neural network (FNN) model. The hybrid LSTM model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.096 and a root mean 
square error (RMSE) of 0.136, which are significantly better than the baseline models.

The study concludes that the proposed hybrid LSTM approach can effectively capture both the global and local patterns in the EV charging station 
occupancy time series data, and can provide accurate and reliable predictions for multistep occupancy forecasting. 
The approach has practical implications for the management of EV charging stations and can potentially lead to more efficient and sustainable 
use of resources.
